# New York Times News Scraper

## What is it?

**All the news that's fit to scrape!**

This app scrapes the newest articles from the New York Times website, and lets users not only save as many of these articles as they choose, but also comment on them (and delete saved articles and comments). 

The most current version of the site is deployed at https://dry-bastion-98819.herokuapp.com/ .

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested so far in Chrome, Firefox, and the latest version of Internet Explorer.
It functions fully on all of these browsers.

Plans to test on Safari upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small to moderately large desktop or notebook (between 1280x800 and 1680x1050), but looks good on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions. 

When loaded properly on a desktop, notebook, or tablet, the homepage should look like this:

The "saved" page should look like this:

The mobile layout of the site should look like this:

**(top part of page; the rest of the page is visible if one keeps scrolling)**

## Future Plans for Improvement
* Add individual user accounts/logins.
* When writing a note for an article, change the heading of the box that pops up so that it has the name of the article and not the article's ID. 
* Modal popup styling tweaks (various things related to box sizing).
